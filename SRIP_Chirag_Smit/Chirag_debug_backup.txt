In this file I have mentioned the various steps (from basics for this project)

1. Install ubuntu server 20.04.5 LTS on raspberry pi using raspberry pi imager.
2. Connect raspberry pi to your local network with internet connection (https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-connect-to-wifi-from-command-line)
   You can check if you are succesful by running ($ ping google.com)
3. Run $sudo apt-get update, $sudo apt-get upgrade
4. Install ROS by following these links: (https://roboticsbackend.com/install-ros-on-raspberry-pi-3/ , http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
5. If you want to add additional ROS packages use ($sudo apt install ros-noetic-PACKAGE_NAME)
6. Build catkin workspace and install dependencies mavlink mavros ( mavlink mavros: https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#installation , catkin: https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_tutorials/blob/master/docs/installing_ros.md, http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)

Launch MAVROS and see Pixhawk telemetry!
roslaunch mavros px4.launch
use https://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/files/magnetic-distrib/ for geographic lib error files
download tar --no-check-certificate, extract, copy and paste to usr/share/GeographicLib
cp -R ./magnetic /usr/share.GeographicLib 
if gui opens up try ctrl +alt + F3 for text mode(terminal)
ctrl + alt + F2 for GUI

tmux:
///here and means leave prev keys
new session start: tmux
hierarchy:  session>>windows>>panes
new pane:
to the right :ctrl + b and %(shift+5)
to the bottom : ctrl + b and "(shift + ')
make as many as you want
switch panes: ctrl + b + left/right arror
new window:
ctrl +b and c  
change windows:
ctrl + b and 0/1/2... as on the green banner below
rename window: ctrl + b and , then type name (see yellow box below) and hit enter
detach from  a session: ctrl + b and d    if using ssh then no need to worry you can continue from where you left
view running tmux sessions : tmux ls
attach to the session: tmux attach -t name_of_session_eg_0
rename session: tmux rename-session -t current_name_of_session name_you_want
new session with name: tmux new -s name_you_want
kill session: tmux kill-session -t name_of_session
sessions runs in background unless closed or system reboot ///

Vim:

///use $ vimtutor    to get basic commands
(see bottom to know the mode you are in)
h(left) j(down) k(up) l(right) or use arrow keys to navigate
:q!  exit without saving
x delete text
esc normal mode
i insert text mode behind
a append text mode ahead (same as i just direction of text adding changes)
vim file_name :to open a file for editing, if no file then creates new file
:wq to save and exit
go to starting word of the word to be removed and type dw to delete it
type d$ at the start of character from which you wish to delete everything (trailing characters get deleted)
d<-operator w/$/e<-motion(tells what to operate on) : w- until start of next word excluding its first character, e- end of current word including last character, $ to the end of line including the last character,d whole line
typing a number before motion repeats it that many times (d2w delete two two words,2w move two words forward, 3e move 3words forward but at last letter of 3rd word, 0 to get to start of word)
dd delets the whole line
u to undo last command, U to bring whole line to original form 
ctrl+R to undo the undo's
to put back text that has just been deleted, type p , this puts the deleted text after the cursor(if a line was deleted (dd)(only one line in vim register)it will go on the line below the cursor)
to replace the character under the cursor, type r and then the character you want to have there
the change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the motion takes you. eg. type ce to change from the cursor to the end of the word, c$ to change to the end of a line
the format for change is: c [number] motion 
ctrl+G shows current file location and it's status
G moves to end of file, gg moves to first line, [line number]+G to move to that line
to find phrases: / followed by phrase searches forward for the phrase ? followed by phrase searches backward, n to find next occurrence in same directionand N prev occurrence, 
ctrl+O takes to older position of yours in file and crtl+I newer
typing % while the cursor is on a (,);[,];{,} goes to it's macth used for debugging missing brackets///
substitute:  new in place of first old in the line:  :s/old/new , new for all old in the line:  :s/old/new/g , new in place of old between two lines for no. # and # #,#s/old/new/g , new in place of old in whole file :%s/old/new/g  to ask for confirmation while doing this :%s/old/new/gc
for running external commands:  : !command   eg. : !ls  lists files in current directory
:w file_name writes the current Vim file to disk with name file_name
pressing v enter into selection mode
v motion :w file_name saves the visually selected lines in the file file_name    in motion here you have to move your cursor to select the text you want
v motion d   deletes the selected text where d is the operator, you can use operator of your choice
:r file_name retrieves disk file file_name and puts it below the current position , you can also use external commands in place of file_name like :r !ls and it puts that commands output below the current cursor position
a,i,A all go to the same insert mode
type o to open a line below O to open a line above cursor and enter insert mode
type a to insert text after the cursor and A to insert text after the end of the line
e command moves to the end of a word
type capital R to start replacing characters until esc pressed
copy paste text: enter visual mode, select text, press y(yank) to copy, press p to paste, yw to copy one word
typing  :set xxx sets the option xxx. some options are ic/ignorecase  ignores upper/lower case when searching ; is/incsearch shoes partial matches ; hls/hlssearch highlights matches
if want to ignore case for just one search command, use \c i.e. /ignore\c
prepend no to switch an option off:  :set noic
type :help or press F1 or HELP to open a help window; type :help cmd to find help on cmd; type ctrl-W ctrl-W to jump to another window; :q to close the help window
can create vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings
when typing a : command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions ; press tab to use one completion///

to kill all roscore/master use: killall -9 roscore and killall -9 rosmaster
do ros master uri and ros hostname in both the devices!!!

pi@raspberrypi:  raspberrypi is the device name and it denotes the ip address so in ROS_MASTER_URI=http://device_name:11311 should come
for ssh to it can be ssh pi@raspberrypi or ssh pi@192.128.1.254 something like that

do rosrun mavros mavcmd long 511 31 5000 0 0 0 0 0    for ATTITUDE_QUATERNION i.e. imu/data
do rosrun mavros mavcmd long 511 105 5000 0 0 0 0 0    for HIGHRES_IMU i.i /mavros/imu/data  

here 31 and 105 are parameters, 5000 is :  5000 gives 200Hz, 10000 give 100Hz   i.e. time is running in microsecond ranges, 511 is something which helps mavros, long is data type(function) of mavros, and 7 commands after 511 are different parameters

mavcmd is in ros             include/lib/  or mavros/scripts/mavcmd
